	// 		"The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles,[11] specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis. The word was deliberately coined to be the longest word in English, and has since been used in a close approximation of its originally intended meaning, lending at least some degree of validity to its claim.[5]\r\rThe Oxford English Dictionary contains pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (30 letters).\r\rMerriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary does not contain antidisestablishmentarianism (28 letters), as the editors found no widespread, sustained usage of the word in its original meaning. The longest word in that dictionary is electroencephalographically (27 letters).[12]\r\rThe longest non-technical word in major dictionaries is flocci\u00ADnauci\u00ADnihili\u00ADpili\u00ADfication at 29 letters. Consisting of a series of Latin words meaning \"nothing\" and defined as \"the act of estimating something as worthless\"; its usage has been recorded as far back as 1741.[13][14][15]\r\rRoss Eckler has noted that most of the longest English words are not likely to occur in general text, meaning non-technical present-day text seen by casual readers, in which the author did not specifically intend to use an unusually long word. According to Eckler, the longest words likely to be encountered in general text are deinstitutionalization and counterrevolutionaries, with 22 letters each.[16]\r\rA computer study of over a million samples of normal English prose found that the longest word one is likely to encounter on an everyday basis is uncharacteristically, at 20 letters.[17]\r\rThe word internationalization is abbreviated \"i18n\", the embedded number representing the number of letters between the first and the last.[18][19][20]. In his play Assemblywomen (Ecclesiazousae), the ancient Greek comedic playwright Aristophanes created a word of 171 letters (183 in the transliteration below), which describes a dish by stringing together its ingredients: Lopado\u00ADtemacho\u00ADselacho\u00ADgaleo\u00ADkranio\u00ADleipsano\u00ADdrim\u00ADhypo\u00ADtrimmato\u00ADsilphio\u00ADparao\u00ADmelito\u00ADkatakechy\u00ADmeno\u00ADkichl\u00ADepi\u00ADkossypho\u00ADphatto\u00ADperister\u00ADalektryon\u00ADopte\u00ADkephallio\u00ADkigklo\u00ADpeleio\u00ADlagoio\u00ADsiraio\u00ADbaphe\u00ADtragano\u00ADpterygon. Henry Carey's farce Chrononhotonthologos (1743) holds the opening line: \"Aldiborontiphoscophornio! Where left you Chrononhotonthologos?\" Thomas Love Peacock put these creations into the mouth of the phrenologist Mr. Cranium in his 1816 romp Headlong Hall: osteosarchaematosplanchnochondroneuromuelous (44 characters) and osseocarnisanguineoviscericartilaginonervomedullary (51 characters). James Joyce made up nine 100-letter words plus one 101-letter word in his novel Finnegans Wake, the most famous of which is Bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk. Appearing on the first page, it allegedly represents the symbolic thunderclap associated with the fall of Adam and Eve. As it appears nowhere else except in reference to this passage, it is generally not accepted as a real word. Sylvia Plath made mention of it in her semi-autobiographical novel The Bell Jar, when the protagonist was reading Finnegans Wake.\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\", the 34-letter title of a song from the movie Mary Poppins, does appear in several dictionaries, but only as a proper noun defined in reference to the song title. The attributed meaning is \"a word that you say when you don't know what to say.\" The idea and invention of the word is credited to songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman. The English language permits the legitimate extension of existing words to serve new purposes by the addition of prefixes and suffixes. This is sometimes referred to as agglutinative construction. This process can create arbitrarily long words: for example, the prefixes pseudo (false, spurious) and anti (against, opposed to) can be added as many times as desired. A word like anti-aircraft (pertaining to the defense against aircraft) is easily extended to anti-anti-aircraft (pertaining to counteracting the defense against aircraft, a legitimate concept) and can from there be prefixed with an endless stream of \"anti-\"s, each time creating a new level of counteraction. More familiarly, the addition of numerous \"great\"s to a relative, e.g. great-great-great-grandfather, can produce words of arbitrary length. In musical notation, an 8192nd note may be called a semihemidemisemihemidemisemihemidemisemiquaver. Antidisestablishmentarianism is the longest common example of a word formed by agglutinative construction.",
